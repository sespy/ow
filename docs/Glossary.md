## Linkage
In MPI, two separate records from different sources that are the same patient and can be linked together in the MPI (MDM?)


## Master Data Management (MDM)
MDM is the activity and resources applied to composition and use of a single source of truth in the form of "blessed" or "golden" records for one or more data domains.

It is a business concept and is independent of the technology used to conduct the activity. It is a key domain of an organization's data office, and not an IT organization.

MDM is not limited to identity data, or to HIM use, rather the scope extends to all business entities, public data sets, industry taxonomies, internal and external reference data, and the like.


## Master Person Index (MPI)
MPI is the activity and resources applied to the composition of master data as it relates to Patients of a health care provider or organization. 

MPI tooling includes capabilities with a patient focus. This focus on "patient" as a data domain brings additional processes and tooling focused on curation, patient-matching, and cross organizational collaboration, for example HIEs.
