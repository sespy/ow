Master Data Management (MDM) is the activity and resources applied to composition and use of a single source of truth in the form of "blessed" or "golden" records for one or more data domains.

It is a business concept and is independent of the technology used to conduct the activity. It is a key domain of an organization's data office, and not an IT organization.

MDM is not limited to identity data, or to HIM use, rather the scope extends to all business entities, public data sets, industry taxonomies, internal and external reference data, and the like.
